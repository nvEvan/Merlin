#Create New Local Branch
git branch -b <local branch name>

#Make changes and Commit to the new branch
...

#For the first push on the new branch: 
git push -u origin <remote branch name>
#Subsequent pushes can be simplified to 
git push
#Note: Pushing/merging to a branch other than 'develop' will not trigger the Jenkins pipeline!

#When you are ready to run changes through the Jenkins pipeline:
git checkout develop
git pull  #Always pull before merging!
#Note: we might use 'git pull --rebase' to keep the commit tree clean
git merge <local branch name> 
git push

#If you are done with the branch:
git push -d origin <remote branch name>  	#Delete remote branch
git branch -d <branch name>					#Delete local branch
